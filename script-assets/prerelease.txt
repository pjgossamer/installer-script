TERMS OF THE PRERELEASE:

1. At any time a new build of Project Gossamer is developed, the current
   and all older builds of Project Gossamer must be recognized and
   assumed "out dated", or closed to bug submission. This means that
   the very second a new build is released, we will no longer be
   tracking bugs.

   this phase. We do not offer any warranty or guarantee for any
   builds on PRERELEASE.
   
3. You may be required to submit information during bug submission
   process to help with Project Gossamer's development. Because of this
